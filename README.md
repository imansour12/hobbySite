### I don't know where to go with this site

I was thinking of making the home page a pseudo IRC channel and implement node js to handle the chat backend.

Whatever happens, I'm suprised it got to this point

Thanks to https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1NM6d7y7O1Q7ZKJ4lLSFw for showing me how to make a navbar and how to make the video play in the background

SIGN UP AND REGISTER PAGES (need these for later maybe):

Unlike facebook, instagram and other amateurs, we do not show you what you like to see, we show you the reality. This is a real world site. This way, we make sure you don't get addicted by constantly decreasing your self esteem.

Should this be a web3.0 application???
